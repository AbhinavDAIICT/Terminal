<br><span style="color:#0CC5DA"><b>Pronounce</b> is a Windows Phone app that teaches correct pronunciation in several accents.<br>
I felt the need of making such an app when I typed my name in dictionary app and pressed the speak button. It pronounced my name in US accent which was nowhere close to how it is actually pronounced. I then tried many dictionary app and I was surprised that all of them gave just the US and UK accent option. So I made this app that takes words and sentences and reads them out in your chosen accent. Though the idea and implementation was very si,ple, yet it addresses a genuine problem.<br>
The app is published in Windows Phone marketplace. You can <u><a href ="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-in/store/app/pronounce/d05ad41b-9d42-4186-a8cb-136c2205fced">find it here.</a></u>
