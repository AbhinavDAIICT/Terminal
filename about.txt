<br><span style="color:#0CC5DA">Hi! I am glad that you actually took the pain of typing a command. Thank you so much for that. There is something that I want to tell you which you probably don't know - you can also click the commands. I did not mention that as it kills the real feel but still implemented this feature for the lazy folks!

So to begin with, I am <b>Abhinav Tripathi</b> - a 2015 batch graduate from Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar. I know that its a long name so you can refer to it as DA-IICT.<br>
As the institute name suggests, its an ICT institue and has only one branch. ICT is an amalgamation of ECE, CS and IT, Isn't it awesome? Well you may think that way but it is too much work!<br>

Lets leave ICT alone and talk about me. I am an <b>innovator</b> who continuously strives to solve existing problems with out-of-the-box solutions. My <b>areas of interest</b> include Web Development, App Development and IoT to some extent.<br>
Apart from this, I love to closely follow stock markets. I think I am a good singer - I'll leave it to you to decide though, in case we happen to meet :)
