<br><span style="color:#0CC5DA"><b>Makodas</b> was a Windows Phone Game that I developed with one of my friends for <b>Microsoft Dream, Build and Play Challenge - 2012</b>. </br> It was a great learning experience for both of us as none of us had any idea about game development. We worked on this game during our first summer vacation in college and ended up in the top 200 all across the world. However, we could not make it to top 5. <br> You find more about this game on my blog  on this <u><a href = "http://dadevelopers.blogspot.in/2014/05/makodas.html">link</a></u> <br> Here is a demo video of the game during development phase (video might take some time to load, please be patient) - <br>
